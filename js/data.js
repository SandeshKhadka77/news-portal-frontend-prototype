    content: "MUMBAI: In what will be remembered as one of the most pulsating encounters in T20 World Cup history, England narrowly survived a massive scare from a resilient Nepal, clinching a 4-run victory at the iconic Wankhede Stadium on Sunday.Chasing a target of 185, the Rhinos pushed the two-time world champions to the absolute limit, finishing their 20 overs at 180/6. The match came down to the final ball, where Nepal needed a six for a historic victory, but Lokesh Bam could only manage a single against a pinpoint yorker from Sam Curran.Match SummaryTeamScoreKey PerformersEngland184/7 (20 ov)Jacob Bethell (55), Harry Brook (53), Will Jacks (39*)Nepal180/6 (20 ov)Dipendra Singh Airee (44), Lokesh Bam (39), Rohit Paudel (39)ResultEngland won by 4 runsPlayer of the Match: Will JacksEngland Rebuild After Early ShocksElecting to bat first, England found themselves in early trouble as Nepal’s bowlers exploited the bounce of the Wankhede track. Sher Malla enjoyed a dream World Cup debut, dismissing Phil Salt with his very first ball. When Nandan Yadav removed Jos Buttler (26) and Sandeep Lamichhane trapped Tom Banton LBW, England were reeling at 57/3.However, a crucial 71-run partnership between Jacob Bethell (55) and captain Harry Brook (53) stabilized the innings. A late blitz by Will Jacks, who hammered 39* off just 18 balls—including 21 runs in the final over—propelled England to a competitive 184.Nepal’s Heroic ChaseNepal’s response was fearless. Despite losing openers early, captain Rohit Paudel (39) and the versatile Dipendra Singh Airee (44) stitched together an 82-run stand that silenced the English fans and ignited the thousands of Nepalese supporters in the stands.When both set batters fell in quick succession, the required rate climbed, but Lokesh Bam reignited the chase. Bam smashed Jofra Archer for two massive sixes in the 18th over, bringing the equation down to 10 runs needed off the final over. Sam Curran, showing nerves of steel, conceded only five runs from the first five deliveries before sealing the win on the final ball.The Road AheadWhile England walks away with two points, Nepal has sent a clear message to Group C that they are no longer just participants, but serious contenders.England next face the West Indies on Wednesday in a battle for the top spot.Nepal will look to bounce back against Italy on Thursday at the same venue"
