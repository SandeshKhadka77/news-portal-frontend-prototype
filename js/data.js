    content: "Mumbai: The cricketing world stood still today as Nepal pulled off one of the greatest upsets in modern T20 history, defeating world giants England by 14 runs in a high-stakes warm-up match at the Wankhede Stadium. Defending a modest total of 158, the Nepali spin twins—Sandeep Lamichhane and Kushal Bhurtel—turned the ball square on a surface that seemed to offer little to others. England’s powerhouse openers, Jos Buttler and Phil Salt, were sent back to the pavilion within the first four overs, leaving the middle order exposed to a relentless Nepali bowling attack. \n\nThe analysis of the game reveals a masterstroke in captaincy by Rohit Paudel, who utilized his death-over specialists with surgical precision. While England’s pacers relied on raw speed, Nepal’s attack focused on variations in pace and length, forcing the English batsmen into mistimed shots. Sompal Kami’s opening spell (2/18) set the tone, but it was the final over by Dipendra Singh Airee that sealed the fate of the defending champions. This victory isn't just a win on paper; it is a statement that Nepal is no longer an 'associate' team in spirit, but a formidable contender ready to disrupt the hierarchy of the 2026 T20 World Cup."
